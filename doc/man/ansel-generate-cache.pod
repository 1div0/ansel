ansel-generate-cache - update ansel's thumbnail cache

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ansel-generate-cache [-h, --help; --version] [-m, --max-mip <0-7>] [--core <ansel options>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ansel> is a digital photography workflow application for B<Linux>, B<Mac OS X> and several other B<Unices>.
It's described further in L<ansel(1)|ansel(1)>.

B<ansel-generate-cache> updates ansel's thumbnail cache.
You can start this program to generate all missing thumbnails in the background when your computer is idle.

=head1 OPTIONS

All parameters are optional.
If started without parameters B<ansel-generate-cache> uses reasonable defaults.

=over

=item B<-h, --help>

Gives usage information and terminates.

=item B<--version>

Gives copyright and version information and terminates.

=item B<< --min-mip <0-7> >>

=item B<< -m, --max-mip <0-7> >>

B<ansel> can handle and store thumbnails with up to eight different resolution steps for each image.
These parameters define which maximum resolution should be generated and default to a range of B<0-2>.
There is normally no need to generate all possible resolutions here; missing ones will be automatically generated by ansel the moment they are needed.
When asked to generate multiple resolutions at once, the lower-resolution images are quickly downsampled from the highest-resolution image.

=item B<< --min-imgid <N> >>

=item B<< --max-imgid <N> >>

Specifies the range of internal image IDs from the database to work on.
If no range is given, B<ansel-generate-cache> will process all images from the entire collection.

=item B<< --core <ansel options>  >>

All command line parameters following B<--core> are passed
to the ansel core and handled as standard parameters.
See L<ansel(1)|ansel(1)> for a detailed description of the options.
