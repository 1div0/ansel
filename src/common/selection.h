/**
 * @file selection.h
 *
 * The old design built selections from collections, through SQL, to ensure selections
 * were always a subset of collections. That didn't work well with the GUI option to show/hide
 * grouped images, because then, every SQL query needed to be modified according to a GUI parameter,
 * which was complicated, hard to debug, tiring to maintain.
 *
 * Collections now are immune to GUI parameters. It is in the thumbtable that we decide to show/hide
 * the thumbnail widgets of grouped images, and collections contain all of them.
 * In order to select grouped images depending on whether they are
 * shown or not, it is also from the thumbtable that batch selection events need to be dispatched, using visible images.
 * It is assumed that users expect selections to include everything visible but only what's visible and nothing more.
 *
 * Because the thumbtable is populated from collections, we know it contains only valid imgid, and contains at most
 * the whole current collection. So we can safely assume any imgid
 * coming from the thumbtable is a valid image ID with regard to the current collection, without additional checks.
 *
 * We synchronize here 2 representations of the selections:
 *  - a memory DB table: memory.selected_images, that is saved to be restored between reboots,
 *  - a GList of imgid, selection->ids, cached, that allows us direct access from C loops.
 *
 * Selections subscribe to the COLLECTION_CHANGED signal to ensure the selected imgids are a subset of the current collection
 * at all time. But that doesn't deal with images that might be hidden from GUI, for example image group members.
 *
 * It is up to the thumbtable code (aka GUI) to resync selection imgids with visible widgets.
 *
 * No insertions or deletions should be made into the `main.selected_images` database table, outside of `selection.c`.
 * Interactions with selections should use the public API here.
 *
 * `SELECT imgid FROM main.seleted_images` should be reserved to SQL JOIN, when fetching metadata from DB for the list of IDs.
 * All other cases should iterate over the GList of imgids returned by `dt_selection_get_list()`
 *
